  <h1>Teaching Philosophy</h1>

  <p>
  In my 10 years of experience teaching over 100 students, I have found that each student is unique, and I adapt my teaching style to suit each individual.
  Having studied pedagogy as part of my doctoral program, I am also experienced in many pedagogical methods.
  In my lessons, I incorporate elements of music theory, composition, and singing in addition to piano playing, and use a variety of musical styles.
  Ultimately, my goal is to help my students enjoy their time with music and reach their full potential.
